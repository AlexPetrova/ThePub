## Missing functionality
* Validation if the user has already made an order for the day.
* Cancel order.
* Orders stats.

## What can be done better
* Unit tests.
* User friendly client-side validations.  
* Server-side validations for the created orders - count of ordered meals, valid ids etc.
* Logic for adding additional meals according to the role of the user to be more extensible.
